                        <p>Oh, what a day it has been. I knew my beloved Marcus, an esteemed senator, had been acting strange recently. I cannot believe that he converted to the religion of Christ, giving up on our Gods! What a grave mistake, especially in a time like this! How could he abandon everything for a god he barely knows? Let me gather my thoughts and retrace what has happened. Last night, he came back home quite late, especially for him. Atticus and Caius, his closest friends, never stay out late. That was just one of many inconsistencies that have happened recently. He also stopped attending ceremonies, claiming he needed to think about his work. I should’ve known!
                            Thank the Gods that I confronted him last night; I can always tell when he is trying to lie. I wonder what he expects to do. Septimius Severus mandates that everyone abides by traditional Roman Mos Maiorum, which includes worshipping the Gods… Will Marcus betray his new God for his sake and his family? Or is he going to be a martyr for his new beliefs? And what will I do? I have three children to look after. What if the Roman officials think that I am also a heretic to the Roman Gods? Should I report him to the authorities? Or should I be a good wife and try to help conceal him? We should run away, maybe we can go to Dacia, or somewhere far enough away where they will not be able to find us. No, he cannot give up his job as a senator; he cannot give up on the people. What if I convert to Christianity? That way, we will not be separated? It pains me to think of what might happen to my adored children Lucius, Aemiliana, and Maximus. Will they have to convert as well? Their life will be so difficult. 
                                The worst part is that when I spoke to Marcus about renouncing his God just to prove he is not a heretic, and then going back to worshipping his Christian Gods, he laughed in my face. He said I would never understand, that his ties to God were more substantial than I could ever imagine. I can’t grasp how somebody could value their beliefs so much more than their well-being and that of their family! Oh, what will I do? Please, Gods, give me a signal! I know what I must do. I am a wife, but most of all, I am a mother. I will safeguard the well-being of my children and report Marcus to the authorities for heresy. It must be done, for the well-being of my little ones.
