                    <p>Description of the project</p>

                    
                    <p>
                        With this project, I wanted to immerse myself in what a household situation might’ve looked like in anti-Christian Rome, when Christianity was outlawed, even though it was starting to become more and more popular. I naturally think of the families that would’ve been destroyed by these developments and the conflicts that people must’ve faced daily, within and with those they loved. And when thinking about where these conflicts might be the strongest, the marital relationship is the first to come to mind. In a bond with so much at stake: emotional and physical wellbeing, financial security, the safety of children, this could have disastrous effects.
                            When thinking of the social and professional makeup of the characters that I chose, I wanted to make sure that I selected protagonists that deeply embody traditional Roman values, while not being too relevant. That is why I decided to settle on a senator and his wife. Marcus, a senator who had begun to act strangely, was well respected and looked up to by the people of his community. Cornelia had all the characteristics of a loving and devout wife, so this situation caused her to struggle profoundly. After an initial very emotional response, she quickly turns back to reason and starts to go through her options methodically. She does not want to betray her husband, but she also wants to look after her children’s interests. Finally, when looking at the whole picture and considering what horrible things might happen to her family if she is seen as an accomplice to this, she decides to report Marcus to the authorities. She evolves from frightened and insecure to very firm in her decision, even though the reader can only imagine how much it might be destroying her from the inside.
                            The historical context that I chose is self-explanatory. Septimius Severus was vehemently opposed to Christianity, and his reign saw a widespread persecution of them. Cornelia, therefore, is placed in an even more complicated situation, leading to even more emotional distress. I was inspired in this sense especially by the Passion of Perpetua and Felicity, a slightly earlier text. There, I could see the emotional strain the persecutions put on her, primarily because of her child, which genuinely inspired this piece. The graphic novel by Rea also truly helped me understand these things.
                            My main goal was to immerse myself and the reader in what religious persecution looked like at the time. By diving into the mind of someone directly affected by these rules, I could better understand what it might have been like to be Christian in 202 CE in Rome.
